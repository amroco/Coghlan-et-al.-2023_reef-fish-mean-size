Abstract: 
Aquatic ectotherms are typically observed to reach smaller body sizes in warmer temperatures. While the underlying mechanisms are debated, numerous temperature-dependent ecological and physiological processes likely interact to influence the magnitude and generality of temperature driven body size changes. By analysing ~15,000 standardised underwater surveys of coastal rocky and coral reefs around the Australian continent, we show a clear trend of decreasing mean individual fish body lengths within communities, as increasing temperature increased. On average, fish in a community decreased in length by ~5% for each 1 oC warming across a 15o C sea surface temperature gradient. This equates to a decrease in mean community level body length by 50% and mean weight by 90%, from 14 oC to 29 oC. The trophic composition of communities also varied with temperature, with herbivores and planktivores, and invertivores and piscivores, dominating community abundance at warm and cool temperatures respectively. Across trophic guilds, mean temperature-body length trends showed similar decreases to the overall community, except for the piscivorous fish, which increased slightly in mean length towards warmer seas. When tropical sites alone were considered, changes in trophic composition explained ~25% in mean community length with the remaining ~75% due to changes in mean body lengths within trophic guilds. In contrast, the trophic guild composition contributed little to variation in mean community body length at cool temperatures. Our findings suggest that small changes in temperature will lead to large changes in fish community body sizes, driven both by changes in community trophic composition and by average body size changes within trophic guilds. Interactions between rising sea temperatures, fish physiology, and ecology add considerable complexity to future predictions of changing ocean food webs.
