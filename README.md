Abstract: 
Aquatic ectotherms often attain smaller body sizes at higher temperatures. By analysing ~15,000 coastal-reef fish surveys across a 15oC spatial sea surface temperature (SST) gradient, we found that the mean length of fish in communities decreased by ~5% for each 1oC temperature increase across space, or 50% decrease in mean length from 14 to 29oC mean annual SST. Community mean body size change was driven by differential temperature responses within trophic groups and temperature-driven change in their relative abundance. Herbivores, invertivores and planktivores all got on average smaller in warmer temperatures, but no trend was found in piscivores. At the warmest sites ~25% of temperature-related community mean size change was from trophic composition, but <1% at colder temperatures due to similar trophic group body sizes. Our findings suggest that small changes in temperature are associated with large changes in fish community composition and body sizes, with important ecological implications.
